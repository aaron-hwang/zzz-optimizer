	// Structure should look like:
	/*
		Run optimizer app
		Optimizer app should accept user input
		(CLI mode basically act like shell? Might not be suited to cli for a prototype, maybe jump straight to desktop app w/gui?)
		Optimizer app should keep track of state of player account, keep track of current characters, weps etc
		Mimic GO design i guess? Initialize
